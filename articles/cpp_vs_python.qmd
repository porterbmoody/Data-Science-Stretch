# C++ vs Python For Machine Learning

## Background

Both C++ and Python are powerful, capable languages. Lets explore some of their pros and cons for machine learning.

Previously, c and c++ languages were mainly just used for developement. With the immergence of data science and machine learning, c and c++ are now being used underneath many data science and machine learning functions. For example, python and r and their data science are written in c, objective c or c++.
