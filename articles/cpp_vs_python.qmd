## Background

Both c++ and python are powerful, capable languages. Let's explore some of their pros and cons for machine learning/ai.

Previously, c and c++ languages were mainly just used for developement. With the immergence of data science and machine learning, c and c++ are now being used underneath many data science and machine learning functions. For example, python and r and their data science are written in c, objective c or c++.

## Conclusion

There are different levels of abstraction of computer interpretable code. Python is the highest therefore the most readable, while c++ is closer to the hardware and more capable for building extremely computationally heavy systems/tools. Then end goal is to develop all machine learning/artificial intelligence packages in c/c++ or something similar that is exretemely rigid, robust, and close to the hardware, then package that code and wrap it into a clean, consise python or (similar language) api. That way the advantages of c++ and python can both be capitalized on.
