That way the advantages of c++ and python can both be capitalized on. Although, in our current age with our current technology, our c++ and python functions are not knit closely enough for this. I tried installing cuda and running some basic python functions on my local gpu and was thrown so many errors I felt like I had to know quite a bit of c++ to debug them. But maybe cloud gpus are the way things are going? Either way, I don't see c++ knowledge being obsolete for a long time. Perhaps it will one day though.
