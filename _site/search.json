Let’s explore some of their pros and cons for machine learning/ai.\nPreviously, c and c++ languages were mainly just used for developement. With the immergence of data science and machine learning, c and c++ are now being used underneath many data science and machine learning functions. For example, python and r and their data science are written in c, objective c or c++.\ntensorflow, pytorch, the tidyverse | c"
